 	Week 3- Day 3 : Coding Challenge

	(Maximum marks -15)



	)Write a program to find biggest number out of three positive numbers, given by user	(5Marks) (Easy) Input:
	a,b,c three numbers output:
	biggest out of them

	example:
	Input:
	a = 10
	b = 5
	c = 15
	Output
	15



	ANSWER

	INPUT

	a = 100
	b = 25
	c = 15

	if a > b:
   		if a > c:
        		print("a is the greatest")
    		else:
        		print("c is the greatest")
	else:
    		if b > c:
        		print("b is the greatest")
    		else:
        		print("c is the greatest")




	) Write a program to find second biggest number out of three positive numbers, given by user	
	(5 Marks) (Easy) Input:
	a,b,c three numbers output:
	second biggest out of them

	example:
	Input:
	a = 10
	b = 5
	c = 15

	Output
	10
	

	ANSWER

	INPUT

	a = 10
	b = 5
	c = 15


	if a > b:
    		if a < c:
        		print(a, "is second greatest")
	elif b > a:
    		if b < c:
        		print(b, "is second greatest")
    	else:
        	print(c, "is second greatest")


	OUTPUT

	PS S:\WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE\Python> py test.py
	10 is second greatest







	Q-3) FizzBuzz - if a number is divisible by 3 - print Fizz, if a number is divisible by 5 - print Fuzz,if a number is divisible by both - print
	Fizz-Buzz.(5 marks)
	(Easy)


	ANSWER

	INPUT
	
	if a % 3 == 0:
    		if a % 5 == 0:
        		print("FizBuzz")
    		else:
        		print("Fizz")
	elif a % 5 == 0:
    		print("Buzz")

	OUTPUT
	
	PS S:\WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE\Python> py test.py
	10
	Buzz
	PS S:\WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE\Python> py test.py
	9
	Fizz
	PS S:\WEB DEVELOPMENT COURSE\Python> py test.py
	15
	FizBuzz
