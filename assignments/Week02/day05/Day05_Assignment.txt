Week 2- Day 2 : Coding Challenge

Q-1 )Write a program that takes a floating point number as input and prints its integer part only.


a = float(input())
b = int(a)
print(b)


Q-2 ) Write a simple program to explain(using comments) the working of type() function


INPUT

a = "21sads"

print (type(a))

# type() function tells us the type of value that we assign to a particular function, weather it is a string , number or boolean.
# in this this example it says it belongs to string class.


OUTPUT


<class 'str'>

Q-3)Write a simple calculator with +, -, *, / support in python Use input() function to take inputs from the user


INPUT


a = input("Enter first Number")
b = input("Enter second Number")

print("sum of two Number =", int(a) + int(b))
print("Subtraction of two Number =", int(a) - int(b))
print("Multiplication of two Number =", int(a) * int(b))
print("Divison of two number =", int(a) / int(b))


OUTPUT

  â€‚
Enter first Number
10
Enter second Number
2
sum of two Number = 12
Subtraction of two Number = 8
Multiplication of two Number = 20
Divison of two number = 5.0
